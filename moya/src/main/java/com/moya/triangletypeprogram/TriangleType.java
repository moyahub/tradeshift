 *  RIGHTISOSCELES,       //Combining the Names RIGHT and ISOSCELES: Has a right angle (90Â°), and also two equal angles
 *  INVALID

 *  and all the above triangle type. and let the class Shape be defined as abstract:
 *  abstract class Shape{ with minimum one method defined as abstract ...} and then
 *  Triangle and the others shape types is defined as subclass of Shape that is:
 *  class Triangle extends Shape {... must implements all abstract methods ...}
